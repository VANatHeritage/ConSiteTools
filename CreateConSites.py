# Version:  ArcGIS 10.3.1 / Python 2.7.8
# Creation Date: 2016-02-25
# Last Edit: 2021-08-20
# Creator:  Kirsten R. Hazler

# Summary:
# Suite of functions to delineate and review Natural Heritage Conservation Sites.
# Includes functionality to produce:
# - Terrestrial Conservation Sites (TCS)
# - Anthopogenic Habitat Zones (AHZ)
# - Stream Conservation Sites (SCS)

# Dependencies:
# Functions for creating SCS will not work if the hydro network is not set up properly! The network geodatabase VA_HydroNet.gdb has been set up manually, not programmatically. The Network Analyst extension is required for some SCS functions, which will fail if the license is unavailable.

   '''Given a National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) feature class, creates a table containing one record for each unique code in the ATTRIBUTE field. The codes in the ATTRIBUTE field are then parsed into easily comprehensible fields, to facilitate processing and mapping. This may be obsolete now that NWI is providing parsed data. (Adapted from a Model-Builder tool and a script tool.) 

   The following new fields are created, based on the value in the ATTRIBUTE field:
   - Syst: contains the System name; this is tier 1 in the NWI hierarchy
   - Subsyst: contains the Subsystem name; this is tier 2 in the NWI hierarchy
   - Cls1: contains the primary (in some cases the only) Class name; this is tier 3 in the NWI hierarchy
   - Subcls1: contains the primary (in some cases the only) Subclass name; this is tier 4 in the NWI hierarchy
   - Cls2: contains the secondary Class name for mixed NWI types
   - Subcls2: contains the secondary Subclass name for mixed NWI types
   - Tidal: contains the tidal status portion of the water regime
   - WtrReg: contains the flood frequency portion of the water regime
   - Mods: contains any additional type modifiers
   - Exclude: contains the value 'X' to flag features to be excluded from rule assignment. Features are excluded if the Mods field codes for any of the following modifiers: Farmed' (f), 'Artificial' (r), 'Spoil' (s), or 'Excavated' (x)

   The output table can be joined back to the NWI polygons using the ATTRIBUTE field as the key.

   '''Submits new (typically automated) Conservation Site features to a Quality Control procedure, comparing new to existing (old) shapes  from the previous production cycle. It determines which of the following applies to the new site:
- N:  Site is new, not corresponding to any old site.
- I:  Site is identical to an old site.
- M:  Site is a merger of two or more old sites.
- S:  Site is one of several that split off from an old site.
- C:  Site is a combination of merger(s) and split(s)
- B:  Boundary change only.  Site corresponds directly to an old site, but the boundary has changed to some extent.

For the last group of sites (B), determines how much the boundary has changed.  A "PercDiff" field contains the percentage difference in area between old and new shapes.  The area that differs is determined by ArcGIS's Symmetrical Difference tool.  The user specifies a threshold beyond which the difference is deemed "significant".  (I recommend 10% change as the cutoff).

Finally, adds additional fields for QC purposes, and flags records that should be examined by a human (all N, M, and S sites, plus and B sites with change greater than the threshold).

In the output feature class, the output geometry is identical to the input new Conservation Sites features, but attributes have been added for QC purposes.  The addeded attributes are as follows:
- ModType:  Text field indicating how the site has been modified, relative to existing old sites.  Values are "N". "M", "S", "I", or "B" as described above.
- PercDiff:  Numeric field indicating the percent difference between old and new boundaries, as described above.  Applies only to sites where ModType = "B".
- AssignID:  Long integer field containing the old SITEID associated with the new site.  This field is automatically populated only for sites where ModType is "B" or "I".  For other sites, the ID should be manually assigned during site review.  Attributes associated with this ID may be transferred, in whole or in part, from the old site to the new site.  
- Flag:  Short integer field indicating whether the new site needs to be examined by a human (1) or not (0).  All sites where ModType is "N", "M", or "S" are flagged automatically.  Sites where ModType = "B" are flagged if the value in the PercDiff field is greater than the user-specified threshold.
- Comment:  Text field to be used by site reviewers to enter comments.  Nothing is entered automatically.

User inputs:
- auto_CS: new (typically automated) Conservation Site feature class
- orig_CS: old Conservation Site feature class for comparison (the one currently in Biotics)
- cutVal: a cutoff percentage that will be used to flag features that represent significant boundary growth or reduction(e.g., 10%)
- out_Sites: output new Conservation Sites feature class with QC information
- fld_SiteID: the unique site ID field in the old CS feature class
- scratchGDB: scratch geodatabase for intermediate products'''

def MakeServiceLayers_scs(in_hydroNet, upDist = 3000, downDist = 500):
   """Creates two Network Analyst service layers needed for SCU delineation. This tool only needs to be run the first time you run the suite of SCU delineation tools. After that, the output layers can be reused repeatedly for the subsequent tools in the SCU delineation sequence.
   
   NOTE: The restrictions (contained in "r" variable) for traversing the network must have been defined in the HydroNet itself (manually). If any additional restrictions are added, the HydroNet must be rebuilt or they will not take effect. I originally set a restriction of NoEphemeralOrIntermittent, but on testing I discovered that this eliminated some stream segments that actually might be needed. I set the restriction to NoEphemeral instead. We may find that we need to remove the NoEphemeral restriction as well, or that users will need to edit attributes of the NHDFlowline segments on a case-by-case basis. I also previously included NoConnectors as a restriction, but in some cases I noticed with INSTAR data, it seems necessary to allow connectors, so I have removed that restriction. The NoCanalDitch exclusion was also removed, after finding some INSTAR sites on this type of flowline, and with CanalDitch immediately upstream.
